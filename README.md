Renita Luxe Website ;


Welcome to the Renita Luxe Hotel website! This document explains the design system, responsive logic, and creative choices that shape the site’s unique luxury experience.

Color System
Palette:

Deep Charcoal : Used for headers, navigation, and overlays to evoke sophistication and modern luxury.

Gold Accent : Highlights call-to-action buttons and badges, symbolizing opulence and exclusivity.

Warm White : Main background for a clean, inviting feel.

Soft Gray : Card backgrounds and section dividers for subtle contrast.

Rich Burgundy : Used sparingly for emphasis and premium cues.

Rationale:
The palette was chosen to reflect the brand’s identity as a luxury Kenyan hotel. Deep neutrals and gold accents communicate elegance, while warm whites and soft grays ensure readability and a welcoming atmosphere. The burgundy touch adds a sense of heritage and exclusivity, aligning with the hotel’s premium positioning.

Breakpoint Logic
Mobile (≤ 767px):

Single-column layout for all sections.

Navigation collapses into a hamburger menu for ease of use.

Carousels and scrollable sections become swipe-friendly.

Tablet (768px – 1023px):

Key sections (e.g., About, Rooms, Amenities) use a two-column grid.

Images and text are balanced side-by-side for better use of space.

Navigation remains simplified but expands to show more options.

Desktop (≥ 1024px):

Multi-column layouts for About, Rooms, and Amenities sections.

Hero and card-style headers are centered with expanded padding.

Navigation is fully visible, with logo centered between left/right navs.

Example:
At the "MD" (medium device) breakpoint (≥768px), the About section switches from a stacked layout to a 2-column grid: text on the left, carousel or images on the right. This improves readability and visual engagement on larger screens.

Creative Divergence from the Mockup
Beyond color adjustments, several creative enhancements were made:

Card-Style Layouts:
The site uses card elements extensively (header, hero, rooms, amenities) to create a tactile, premium feel and improve content separation.

Icon Carousels:
Instead of static features, the About section uses an interactive icon carousel to highlight hotel strengths and guest experiences, adding dynamism and engagement.

Partner Carousel:
The Trusted Partners section is presented as a horizontally scrollable carousel, showcasing collaborations in a visually engaging way.

Room & Amenity Carousels:
Room types and amenities are displayed with swipeable cards and badges (e.g., "Most Popular", "Premium"), making browsing intuitive and visually rich.

Mobile-First Navigation:
The navigation is reimagined for mobile, with a hamburger menu and touch-friendly links, ensuring a seamless luxury experience on all devices.

Typography:
The site employs Montserrat for modern clarity and Playfair Display for classic elegance, reinforcing the luxury brand image.

Summary;

The Renita Luxe site blends a refined color palette, responsive grid logic, and creative UI enhancements to deliver a digital experience worthy of a five-star hotel. Every detail—from interactive carousels to tactile card layouts—was designed to evoke comfort, exclusivity, and authentic Kenyan luxury.
